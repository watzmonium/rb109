RUN YOUR CODE!

say 'local variable' instead of 

shovel operator method <<

SELECT - selects the value if evaluated to true - if an operation can be performed, that value is slected

PUTS - interpolates all values 'to_s'

local variable capitals is initialized to the return value of the select method called on letters

variables within scope of a block is a 'parameter' rather than just a local variable

variables acting as pointers

1) local variable scope, especially how local variables interact with method invocations with blocks and method definitions

2) mutating vs non-mutating methods

3) iterating through collections

4) variables as pointers

5) puts vs return

6) false vs nil and the idea of "truthiness"

7) method definition and method invocation

8) implicit return value of method invocations and blocks

9) how the Array#sort method works

10) passing arguments (reference/value) (if the object is mutated, it acts like pass by value, if mutated, it's more pass by value since the original value remains)

```ruby

```
